#### Crafting our own application using the Google API and witnessing it in action transforms the experience into something truly distinctive.

  

### Google Generative AI Sample for Web (Javascript)

This sample app demonstrates how to use state-of-the-art generative AI models (like Gemini) to build AI-powered features and applications.

  

To try out this sample app, you'll need a modern web browser and a local http server.

  

## Requirements

  

Follow the instructions on Google AI Studio [setup page](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) to obtain an API key.

  

Itâ€™s strongly recommended that you do not check an API key into your version control system. Instead, you should use a secrets store for your API key.

  

The Node.js http server provided alonside this app (http-server.js) assumes that you're providing an API\_KEY environment variable.
